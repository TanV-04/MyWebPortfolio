    World over, children, patients, and others are paying an enormous price for
    climate change and pollution. It is estimated that by 2 030, 132 million
    people could be pushed into poverty by climate change, and almost half the
    world's children are at high risk from climate impacts.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, take India, where even literate people behave like illiterate
    ones, and the latter are no better either. They still think of pollution and
    global warming as fiction, harmless and to be taken lightly. These are the
    people who might read an article or blog like mine, and turn a blind eye as
    soon as they see "global warming" thinking, "the topic's so common in
    newspapers and magazines, what good will it do them to read another one,
    where the writer just rambles on about saving earth and preventing
    pollution, which is certainly not their cup of tea."
  </p>

  <p>
    Delhi, the world's most polluted city, sits shrouded in smog, a black mole
    on India's face as seen from satellites. People and politicians alike
    stubbornly refuse to change their ways. This happens all over India, so it's
    nothing new. People blame the government for not taking actions about the
    pollution crisis, but they don't realize the pressure the government's
    already under! This leaves the matters in the hands of citizens, if only we
    consented to work together and look into the crisis.

    Last year, when the behemoth known as Covid struck, it hindered Indians from
    bursting firecrackers on Diwali. But this year, everyone seemed to be taking
    revenge on the virus by blowing up firecrackers on Earth's face. When you
    try to make these people understand, they'll be like, "You're hurting our
    religious sentiments, it's Diwali for gods' sake! Let us enjoy!" and they'll
    wave you off for wasting their precious time from polluting.
  </p>

  <p>
    One also thinks of uprooting the tree of firecrackers, the phataka shops, to
    stop people from bursting firecrackers altogether, but they'll be faced with
    harsh resistance from politicians and citizens because these shops
    contribute a lot to taxes and money for the government. As soon as the money
    starts flowing in, any average Indian starts drooling over it and forgets
    about everything else. Although bursting firecrackers has been banned in a
    few Indian states, the implementation has been very poor. Such is the
    condition in India.
  </p>

  <p>
    We, humans, make big talks about cutting down fossil fuel usage, sign new
    agendas for preventing pollution, and hold summits (we've been doing that
    for a long time) but these responsibilities fall on blind eyes, deaf ears,
    and numb and corrupted minds.
  </p>

  <p>
    So for those non-believers, I hereby present the effects and statistical
    outcomes of the predicament we're in:
  </p>

  <div class="numbered-list">
    <ul>
      <li>
        First of all, many firecrackers still use traditional gunpowder,
        containing potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal, and a few oxidizers
        that are now replaced by perchlorates. These perchlorates cause
        hypothyroidism in children and adults alike. They also lead to thyroid
        cancer.
      </li>
      <li>
        The smoke from the burnt charcoal and sulfur releases particulate
        matter, targeting those suffering from asthma and chemical
        sensitivities. Prolonged exposure can cause lung cancer.
      </li>
      <li>
        The metallic compounds used in firecrackers to impart color and sparkle
        have adverse effects on the environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        These effects, including water scarcity, fossil fuel combustion, burning
        trash and crops (as seen in Haryana and Punjab), melting of glaciers,
        and more, add on to global warming. Because of this:
        <h1> - Over 90% of children on Earth are now highly exposed to air
          pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion.</h1>

        <h1> - Over 820 million children and people are highly exposed to severe
          heat waves, worsening as the global average temperatures rise.</h1>
        <h1> - More than 920 million are highly exposed to water scarcity, which
          will intensify as climate change increases droughts, water stress,
          and competition for water.</h1>

        <h1> - 400 million children are prone to cyclones and flooding due to
          rising water levels and coastal flooding.</h1>

        <h1> - The Arctic is heating twice as fast as any other location on Earth,
          shrinking the Arctic sea by 14% per decade. Because of this, polar
          bears now face extinction.</h1>

        <h1> - Tigers have lost 95% of their habitats with sea level rise and
          heightened mangrove deforestation. African elephants face climate
          change drying their water resources and land because of human
          encroachment. They have lost 30% of their geographical range. Yet,
          they're still hunted every year for their ivory tusks.</h1>
  

      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    The climate and pollution problem is not just a technological or a
    socio-economic problem, it's majorly a political one, largely driven by
    political leaders so focused on getting re-elected that they prioritize
    their interests and leave their left-over fortune for climate issues, which
    isn't much. Unaware people and politicians don't realize that today's
    children will have to deal with climate change for decades if we don't start
    solving the problem now. Every country needs aware and concerned leaders and
    youth, who can put their self-interests aside, and slowly start working on
    the issue. If this article/blog has actually made an impact on you, that's
    awesome, but if it hasn't, please forgive me for not trying harder to
    persuade you to <strong>Stop This Outrageous Pollution</strong>.
